# About this project

This project is a very specific usecase that really is probably not the way to approach optical character recognition but existing solutions did not really provide what I wanted to do.
Basically, the idea of the project is to use OCR to extract text by passing it to chatgpt's api and through that get an output file that is then further modified to fit the specific format
I want for the output to have.
